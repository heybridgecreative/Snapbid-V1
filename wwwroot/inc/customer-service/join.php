<p><strong>Joining Snapbid</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snapbid is a new innovative booking site that focuses on empty bed nights and occupancy rates of your property.</p>
<p>The site allows the vendor to privately post availability at a competitive discounted rate without undermining the brand or normal pricing structures.</p>
<p>Using an online bidding system the proprietor stays in control of the reservations and prices that they wish to sell at as a minimum.</p>
<p>By placing a reserve on the sale price the accommodation provider has the opportunity to accept the highest bid above the acceptable price.</p>
<p>Regular bookings can also be carried out on the site&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our competitive commission rates allow the vendor to earn the same amount from the booking whilst selling at a lower price.</p>
<p><strong>Snapbid Benefits</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Due to the fact that the accepted or acceptable price is never posted publically and the client that books is a member of the Snapbid club, transactions do not contravene existing contracts with alternative booking sites.</li>
<li>The simple bidding system allows the potential client to find, compare and book in real time, giving a fast and effective procedure that suits not only desktop computers, but mobiles and tablets, which allow the client to download a consumer friendly app.</li>
<li>There is a secure online payment system that will guarantee payment in advance, on exit or deposits, subject to conditions of booking and cancellation policies.</li>
<li>Registering your property is free of charge, with no ongoing fees other than agreed commission rates on completed transactions.</li>
<li>An easy, cloud based booking system that has secure passwords changed regularly that only allows authorised key personnel to access the system.</li>
<li>The ability to load available accommodation simply and efficiently.</li>
<li>No restrictions on the amount of rooms that can be posted on the site. The vendors can cap the amount of rooms they want to auction or sell on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Client&rsquo;s contact details will be provided to the vendor to allow them to contact them in the future and market them directly for potential future bookings. This is subject to the client giving their consent.</li>
<li>Special deals can also be placed on the site, where the vendor can offer promotional packages that attract clients.</li>
<li>Special events such as Exhibitions, economic forums, concerts, sporting events etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;Can be highlighted on the site where the vendor can increase the price above the normal tariff and sell to the highest bidder.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Snapbid Pricing</strong></p>
<p>The vendor is encouraged to offer vacant accommodation that is not normally sold at discounted prices. If the occupancy rate of your premises is lower, due to seasonal trends, it is recommended that the reserve price be considerably lower than the normal rate to attract clients to book rather than have empty nights at your establishment. Restricting the amount of rooms/nights that are offered in to a bidding platform, can have the affect of &lsquo;&rsquo;first come, first served&rsquo;&rsquo; to any potential client.</p>
